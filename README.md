I used the "Identity" and "Alpha" website templates from http://html5up.net for my website, so I didn't upload all of the
css files or anything that isn't included in the template / easily downloadable already :)

Really the only thing maybe worth seeing (for now) is the tau.js file, which powers [this](https://onnoeberhard.com/tau) site.
